Build a responsive coffee shop website using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS 
A coffee shop website serves as a digital storefront, allowing potential customers to learn about the shop, its menu, location, and even place orders online. It's a central hub for all essential information, creating a seamless customer experience and fostering loyalty.
